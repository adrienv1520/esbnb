# esbnb, the eslint airbnb config installer

###Installation

It is recommended to install esbnb globally.

`npm i -g esbnb`

###Usage

#####Install Airbnb config (by default)

Run `esbnb` at the root of your project.


#####Install Airbnb base config

Run `esbnb base` at the root of your project.

#####Install Airbnb base/legacy config

Run `esbnb legacy` at the root of your project.


###Configuration

.eslintrc:
```javascript
{
  "extends": "airbnb" // or airbnb-base or airbnb-base/legacy
}
```

esbnb install and automatically configure your `.eslintrc` file. It only adds the configuration name in the `extends` property. If some values were present that are not airbnb config name, the `extends` property will be an array with all configuration name to be extended to.

Before any process, a copy of your `.eslintrc` is made in the case of something would go wrong. You'll find it in the **esbnb** package installed globally in the *configs* directory.

If no `.eslintrc` file were found, a new one will be created with proper configuration.


###Test

Run `npm test` to
- lint with eslint (airbnb config base),
- run mocha unit tests with Chai.
